# Live LibreOffice Python

Live LibreOffice Python is a complete development environment for creating, debugging and testing python scripts. It leverages the power of [VS Code] and has [LibreOffice] baked in that can be access via the internal web browser or via your local web browser which allows for a much more pleasant and consistent debugging experience.

With the power of [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) it is possible to have [VS Code] and [LibreOffice] running together. One big benefit is a isolated and [VS Code]/[LibreOffice] environment.

Locally a project based upon this template can also be run in a [Development Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/overview).

It is also possible to use [GitHub CLI/CD] to create a workflow that test your project with the presents of LibreOffice. This template has a working example of testing using [GitHub CLI/CD].

There are Built in [Tools](https://github.com/Amourspirit/live-libreoffice-python/wiki/Tools) such as [gitget](https://github.com/Amourspirit/live-libreoffice-python/wiki/Tools#gitget) that allow you to quickly add examples to your project from sources such as [LibreOffice Python UNO Examples]. Also there is a built in [console](https://github.com/Amourspirit/live-libreoffice-python/wiki/Console) to help debug the [API](https://api.libreoffice.org/).

This templated can also be leveraged to demonstrate working examples of code.
